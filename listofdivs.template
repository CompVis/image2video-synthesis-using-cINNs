Figure 2. Our approach uses a convolutional VQGAN to learn a codebook of context-rich visual parts, whose composition is subsequently modeled with an autoregressive transformer architecture. A discrete codebook provides the interface between these architectures and a patch-based discriminator enables strong compression while retaining high perceptual quality. This method introduces the efficiency of convolutional approaches to transformer based high resolution image synthesis.

Table 1. Comparing Transformer and PixelSNAIL architectures across different datasets and model sizes. For all settings, transformers outperform the state-of-the-art model from the PixelCNN family, PixelSNAIL in terms of NLL. This holds both when comparing NLL at fixed times (PixelSNAIL trains roughly 2 times faster) and when trained for a fixed number of steps. See Sec. 4.1 for the abbreviations.

Figure 7. Evaluating the importance of effective codebook for HQ-Faces (CelebA-HQ and FFHQ) for a fixed sequence length |s|= 16·16 = 256. Globally consistent structures can only be modeled with a context-rich vocabulary (right). All samples are generated with temperature t = 1.0 and top-k sampling with k = 100.

Figure 8. Trade-off between negative log-likelihood (nll) and reconstruction error. While context-rich encodings obtained with large factors f allow the transformer to effectively model long-range interactions, the reconstructions capabilities and hence quality of samples suffer after a critical value (here, f = 16).

Figure 9. We compare the ability of VQVAEs and VQGANs to learn perceptually rich encodings, which allow for high-fidelity reconstructions with large factors f . Here, using the same architecture and f = 16, VQVAE reconstructions are blurry and contain little information about the image, whereas VQGAN recovers images faithfully. See also Sec. B.

Bottom: The transformer architecture is permutation invariant but next-token prediction is not: The average loss on the validation split of ImageNet, corresponding to the negative log-likelihood, differs significantly between different prediction orderings. Among our choices, the commonly used row-major order performs best.
